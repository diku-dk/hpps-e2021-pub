## Video
This is the equivelent networking lecture from last year. It is presented differently, covers slightly different topics, and 
was actually the second lecture as last year we approached the topic from the lowest level first whilst we are going to go from 
the highest level. Nevertheless, it is still a good resource if the remote lecture doesn't work / you can't make it.
