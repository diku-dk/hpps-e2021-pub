# Syllabus and Material for High Performance Programming and Systems (HPPS) 

Welcome to the course website for HPPS!  While assignment handin is
still on Absalon, all material and information will be located here.
You are not expected to treat this repository as anything more than a
website, but feel free to clone it if you are already comfortable with
Git.

## Basics

HPPS takes place in block 2.  There are three kinds of in-person
teaching activities: **lectures**, **exercises** and the **study
café**.  All take place physically on campus.

**Lectures** are mostly conventional, but may use aspects of the
[flipped classroom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flipped_classroom)
approach.

**Exercises** are conducted in four smaller classes, each conducted by
a teaching assistant (TA).  An exercise session involves working on
problems that will help you learn the curriculum, and in many cases
directly train you in the skills you will need for the mandatory
assignments.

**Study cafés** are places where you can get assistance with the
mandatory assignments.

**This course website** is used for handing out material.

**Discord** can be used for asking questions. [Invite link](https://discord.gg/E8UceNW5pp).

**Absalon** is used for handing in assignments and for course announcements.

## Textbook

The textbooks are as follows:

* **BOH:** [Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective, 3rd edition](https://csapp.cs.cmu.edu/) (global edition)

* **JG:** [Modern C](https://modernc.gforge.inria.fr/) ([CC-licensed PDF](https://hal.inria.fr/hal-02383654/document))

* **HPPS:** [HPPS course notes](notes.pdf) - **these will be updated as the
  course progresses, so make sure to regularly check that you have
  the newest version**

### Textbook videos

The authors of the CS:APP textbook [have made videos available of their
lectures](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmBgoRqEQCWy58EIwLSWwMPfkwLOLRM5R).
Note that these lectures are from a classic systems programming
course, with a different focus (and much longer length) than HPPS.
However, they may still be worth watching.

## Schedule

### Tuesday

* **Lecture:** 10:00-12:00 (Lille UP-1, DIKU).

### Thursday

* **Lecture:** 10:00-12:00 (Aud 04, HCØ)

* **Exercises:** 13:00-15:00

Exercises are split along four *hold*, in the following rooms
and TAs:

* **Hold 1:** 1-0-37 (DIKU), Noah Stonall <stonall@di.ku.dk>

* **Hold 2:** 1-0-04 (DIKU), Christian Arboe Franck <fpk278@alumni.ku.dk>

* **Hold 3:** Auditorium Nord, Nørre Allé 51, NEXS, Albert Alonso de la Fuente <albert.alonso@nbi.ku.dk>

* **Hold 4:** 3-0-25 (DIKU), Anas Youssef Idiab <hjr420@alumni.ku.dk>

### Friday

* **Study café:** 13:00-15:00 at A110, A111, C103, all at HCØ.
  Depending on needs, we may not use all these rooms.

## Assignments

There are 5 assignment in total during the course with deadlines
roughly every week.

The assignments will be graded with points from 0 to 4 and it is not
possible to re-hand-in any of the assignments.

Assignments are made to be solved in groups of preferably three
students, but groups of two active students will also do. We strongly
encourage you not to work alone. Groups cannot be larger than three
students. Each group must make their own solutions and cannot share
implementations and report with other. You may however discuss
material and ideas.

* **Handin deadline:** 3/12

[Text](assignments/a1/a1.pdf), [code handout](assignments/a1/a1-handout.tar.gz).

## Study café

You can get help for assignments at the study cafés every Friday
13:00-15:00.

## Exam qualification

To qualify for the exam you are required to achieve at least 50% of
the total number of points in the four assignments (that is, 10 points
at minimum). You also need to get *at least* one point pr. assignment.

## Languages

All written material will be in **English**.

Most oral teaching will be in **Danish** or **English**, depending on
the specific teacher or TA.

You will mainly be programming in **C** and **Python**.


## Software

You will be using a Unix command line and Unix tools for much of the
course.  [See the Unix software guide.](unix.md)

See also [this guide on the GDB
debugger](http://beej.us/guide/bggdb/), which is a very useful tool
for debugging C programs.

If you prefer an IDE see the [VS Code installation and setup guide](VSCode.md).
